# Commissions and Invoices Data Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Commissions Sheet Data Handling**

#### Problem:
- Commission sheet range was limited to `A:Z` (26 columns)
- With 2 new columns added each month, this would quickly exceed the limit
- Not properly capturing all dynamic month columns

#### Solution:
- **Expanded Range**: Changed from `'Commissions'!A:Z` to `'Commissions'!A:ZZ` (676 columns)
- **Enhanced Processing**: Improved column processing to capture all month data, even empty cells
- **Better Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to track month columns detection

#### Changes Made:
```javascript
// Before: Limited range
"'Commissions'!A:Z"

// After: Extended range  
"'Commissions'!A:ZZ"

// Improved processing logic
for (let i = 4; i < headers.length; i++) {
  const headerText = headers[i]?.trim() || '';
  const cellValue = row[i] || '';
  
  if (headerText) {
    // Store all month columns, even if empty
    commission[headerText] = cellValue;
  }
}
```

### 2. **Invoices Data Structure Issues**

#### Problem:
- Data structure mismatch between API and components
- API provided `AmountDue` but components expected `Amount`
- Inconsistent field names causing display issues

#### Solution:
- **Dual Field Support**: Provide both `Amount` and `AmountDue` fields for compatibility
- **Enhanced Structure**: Ensure all expected invoice fields are properly mapped
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved debugging for invoice data processing

#### Changes Made:
```javascript
// Before: Only AmountDue field
return {
  Network: row[0]?.trim() || '',
  PeriodStart: row[1]?.trim() || '',
  PeriodEnd: row[2]?.trim() || '',
  DueDate: row[3]?.trim() || '',
  AmountDue: row[4]?.trim() || '0',
  InvoiceNumber: row[5]?.trim() || ''
};

// After: Both Amount and AmountDue for compatibility
return {
  Network: row[0]?.trim() || '',
  PeriodStart: row[1]?.trim() || '',
  PeriodEnd: row[2]?.trim() || '',
  DueDate: row[3]?.trim() || '',
  Amount: row[4]?.trim() || '0',      // Added for component compatibility
  AmountDue: row[4]?.trim() || '0',   // Kept for backward compatibility
  InvoiceNumber: row[5]?.trim() || ''
};
```

## Enhanced Debugging

### Commissions Debugging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Total number of columns in Commission sheet
- Month-specific columns (containing '202')
- All headers from column E onwards
- Detected month data in processed commissions

### Invoices Debugging
Improved logging to show:
- Raw invoice response structure
- Processed invoice count
- Sample processed invoices

## Expected Results

### Commissions:
1. ✅ **Unlimited Columns**: Can now handle unlimited monthly columns (up to ZZ = 676 columns)
2. ✅ **Dynamic Detection**: Automatically captures new month columns as they're added
3. ✅ **Complete Data**: Ensures all month data is captured, including empty cells for structure consistency
4. ✅ **Better Monitoring**: Enhanced logging helps track what months are being detected

### Invoices:
1. ✅ **Field Compatibility**: Components can now access invoice amounts using either `Amount` or `AmountDue`
2. ✅ **Consistent Structure**: All invoice fields properly mapped and available
3. ✅ **Better Display**: Invoice data should now display correctly in all components
4. ✅ **Improved Debugging**: Better logging for troubleshooting invoice data issues

## Components Affected

### Commissions:
- `CommissionPayments.jsx` - Will now receive complete month data
- `AccountsView.jsx` - Commission tab will show all available months
- Any component using commission data

### Invoices:
- `InvoicesTable.jsx` - Will now display invoice amounts correctly
- `CashPosition.jsx` - Invoice calculations will work properly
- `ExpenseOverview.jsx` - Invoice totals will be accurate
- `CashFlowProjection.jsx` - Invoice data for projections

## Testing

After these changes:
1. **Commission data** should show all months with 2 columns each (revenue + commission)
2. **Invoice amounts** should display correctly in all invoice-related components
3. **New month columns** in Commissions sheet will be automatically captured
4. **Console logs** will show detailed information about detected columns and data structure

## Future-Proofing

- **Commissions**: Range now supports up to 676 columns (ZZ), sufficient for many years of monthly additions
- **Invoices**: Dual field support ensures compatibility with different data source formats
- **Dynamic Processing**: Both systems now automatically adapt to data structure changes
